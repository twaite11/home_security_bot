# home_security_bot
This project is an intelligent, edge-based home security system that uses deep learning for real-time person detection and facial recognition. It runs entirely on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX, making all security decisions locally without relying on the cloud.  The system uses an Intel RealSense D455 camera, Jetson Xavier NX, and an ardunioR3 for visual output.
